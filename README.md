# KNN
The abbreviation KNN stands for “K-Nearest Neighbour”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements. The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'.
